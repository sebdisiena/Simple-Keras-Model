# Simple Perceptron Model using Keras

## Objective 
- Project to implement the Tensorflow and Keras libraries to train and test a single layer neural network to classify a dataset into 2 discrete classes

## Method
- Similar method applied to that used in the [Simple Perceptron Model](https://github.com/sebdisiena/Simple-Perceptron-Model?tab=readme-ov-file) repository
- Utilised Keras' Adam stochastic gradient descent model  

## Results
- Accuracy of 0.9754 after 500 epochs
